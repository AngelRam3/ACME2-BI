## Work Summary (Developer Facing)

In this sprint, we focused on the documentation of the project, as well as meeting with our client and the professor. We have completed the Project Description and Requirements and Specifications sections. The work was divided among the team members (Joshna & Angel) and we each were assigned tasks for us to complete. We have met with our client, Christene Weaver from Breast Intentions, to further discuss what type of project we would create for them. After further discussion, and with the professor's approval, we have determined that Breast Intentions needs a new inventory mangagement system. We are currently in the process of proposing ideas to the client, like the hosting platform for this system, and we have finalized the features that will need to be included to fufill Breast Intentions' needs. We as individuals took the time to learn more about the MERN tech stack to better prepare the team to work on the project.
