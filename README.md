# ACME2-Breast Intentions

## Project summary

Breast Intentions seeks to improve its online presence and engagement through strategic social media and website optimization, all to attract more donors and volunteers to support this donation-based organization.

### Additional information about the project

Breast Intentions needs an inventory management system that will better tend to its needs as a non-profit organization as they help underserved women. They currently use Square which does not provide the necessary functionality they desire. This is why we have been tasked to create an inventory management system for them.
